# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Fixed critical import error in entrypoint.js
  - The `eq` operator is now correctly imported from 'drizzle-orm' instead of 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless'
- ✅ Fixed ES Module issues in entrypoint.js
  - Changed CommonJS `require()` to ES Module imports
  - Moved all imports to the top of the file

## Required Environment Variables
Before deploying to Vercel, make sure to set these environment variables in the Vercel project settings:

### Critical Variables
- [ ] DATABASE_URL - PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] SESSION_SECRET - Random string for session encryption
- [ ] NODE_ENV - Should be set to "production"

### Feature-Dependent Variables
- [ ] STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - Required for payment processing
- [ ] STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET - Required for Stripe webhooks
- [ ] MAILJET_API_KEY - Required for email functionality
- [ ] MAILJET_API_SECRET - Required for email functionality
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME - Required for file uploads
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_API_KEY - Required for file uploads
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET - Required for file uploads

## Deployment Process
1. Push the fixed code to your GitHub repository
2. Create a new project on Vercel and import your GitHub repository
3. Set all the required environment variables
4. Deploy the project

## Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check that the application loads properly
2. Verify API routes are working (test /api/health endpoint)
3. Test authentication flows
4. Test file uploads (if implemented)
5. Test payment processing (if implemented)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- If you see 404 errors, check the Vercel dashboard logs and verify the static build output
- If there are module resolution errors, make sure all imports are correctly structured
- If database connections fail, verify your DATABASE_URL and ensure your database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges

## Performance Optimizations
- Consider setting up edge caching for static assets
- Use serverless-optimized database connection settings
- Keep dependencies minimal to reduce cold start times
